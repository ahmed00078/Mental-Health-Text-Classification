# Mental Health Text Classification

## Overview
This project is part of the **GO DATA SCIENCE 4.0 - Mental Health Challenge** hosted on Zindi. The goal is to build a machine learning model that classifies textual content into mental health-related categories such as depression, anxiety, and relationship-related issues. The model aims to detect early signs of mental health struggles from text data, enabling timely support and intervention.

---

## Problem Statement
Millions of individuals share their mental health struggles online, and early detection of these issues can be crucial for providing support. In this challenge, participants are tasked with building a model that accurately classifies text into predefined mental health categories.

**Evaluation Metric**: Accuracy

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mental-health-hackathon.git
cd mental-health-hackathon
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment
#### Using Conda
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mental-health-env
```

#### Using Pip
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the Dataset
- Download the dataset from the [Zindi competition page](https://zindi.africa/competitions/...).
- Place the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files in the `data/` folder.

---

## Execution Order
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Run the `notebooks/EDA.ipynb` notebook to analyze the dataset and understand its structure.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Run the `notebooks/preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to clean and preprocess the data (e.g., tokenization, handling missing values, etc.).

3. **Model Training**
   - Run the `notebooks/model_training.ipynb` notebook to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

4. **Generate Submission File**
   - Run the `notebooks/submission.ipynb` notebook to create the final submission file (`submission.csv`) and save it in the `submissions/` folder.

## Model Details
- **Approach**: We used a [insert model name, e.g., BERT, GPT, or a traditional ML model] for text classification.
- **Preprocessing**: The text data was preprocessed by [describe preprocessing steps, e.g., tokenization, stopword removal, etc.].
- **Training**: The model was trained on [describe training setup, e.g., Google Colab, local machine, etc.].
- **Evaluation**: The model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy] on the validation set.

---

## Hardware Requirements
- **Google Colab**: Recommended for running the notebooks. Ensure you enable GPU acceleration for faster training.
- **Local Machine**: If running locally, ensure you have at least 16GB RAM and a GPU for efficient training.

---

## Expected Runtime
- **EDA**: ~10 minutes
- **Preprocessing**: ~15 minutes
- **Model Training**: ~1 hour (depending on the model and hardware)
- **Submission Generation**: ~5 minutes
